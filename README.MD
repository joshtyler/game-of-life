#game-of-life

A simple game of life implementation written in C.

This program was created as part of an introduction to C class. The three versions of the program behave differently, with TYLERJ-life3.c being the most advanced.

The lextolife directory contains a small program to convert game of life states from Stephen Silver's lexicon to a format acceptable by the program.

## Notes

The program uses tabs/spaces in a strange way, so will look odd with a tab width different to two.
